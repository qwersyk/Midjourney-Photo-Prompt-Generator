# Midjourney-Photo-Prompt-Generator
This is an extension for Newelle that creates a prompt for images from Midjourney. We use the prompt from [Kazrik](https://flowgpt.com/p/midjourney-photo-prompt-generator). This is a simple extension. You just add a file folder to via the extensions tab in Newelle.
